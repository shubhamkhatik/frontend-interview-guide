### Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr` of integers containing `n` elements and an integer `k`. Rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` can be any positive integer (less than or equal to 1000). Rotation means each element of the array is shifted right by one position, and the last element moves to the beginning.

---

### Input Format

- First line contains an integer `n`, the size of the array `arr`.  
- Second line contains `n` space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array `arr`.  
- Third line contains an integer `k`.

---

### Input Constraints

- \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)  
- \(-10^4 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^4\)  
- \(1 \leq k \leq 10^4\)

---

### Output Format

Output the rotated array as a space-separated string.

---

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
2



Output:
4 5 1 2 3



Explanation: Rotating `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` two steps to the right results in `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.

**Example 2**

Input:
6
10 20 30 40 50 60
4



Output:
40 50 60 10 20 30



Explanation: Rotating `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]` four steps to the right results in `[40, 50, 60, 10, 20, 30]`.




###  Solution
```
function solution(n, arr, k) {
// Since rotating by n steps brings the array to original state,
// we only need to rotate by k % n steps
const steps = k % n;

// Slice the last 'steps' elements and concatenate
// with the rest at front
const rotated = arr.slice(-steps).concat(arr.slice(0, n - steps));

// Print the rotated array as space-separated string
console.log(rotated.join(' '));
}

```

---

### Explanation:

- `k % n` handles the case where `k` might be greater than `n`.
- `arr.slice(-steps)` extracts the last `steps` elements.
- `arr.slice(0, n - steps)` extracts the first part of the array before the rotation.
- Concatenating these gives the rotated array.
- Finally, output the rotated array as requested.
